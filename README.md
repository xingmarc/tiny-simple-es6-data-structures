# Tiny Simple ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) Data Structure

This is a very tiny and simple data structure making use of some ECMAScript 2015 new features.

Inspired by James Kyle's [itsy-bitsy-data-structures](https://github.com/thejameskyle/itsy-bitsy-data-structures). I highly recommend you to read his first.

I learned all the new features of ES6 from Nicholas C. Zakas' book [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6).

## Features
1, **class** and class inheritance.

2, **Proxy** and **Reflection API**

3, **generator**

Besides, in the code I showed a way to make some `private` javascript class members.

Hope you like it!
